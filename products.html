    <h3>About this app</h3>

    <p>Think of all of the pieces of data in our example application. We have:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The original list of products</li>
      <li>The search text the user has entered</li>
      <li>The value of the checkbox</li>
      <li>The filtered list of products</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Let’s go through each one and figure out which one is state.
    </p>

    <h4>Ask 3 questions about each piece of data</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.</li>
      <li>Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.</li>
      <li>Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Apply these rules to our app:</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>The original list of products is passed in as props, so that’s not state.</li>
      <li>The search text and the checkbox seem to be state since they change over time and can’t be computed from anything. </li>
      <li>And finally, the filtered list of products isn’t state because it can be computed by combining the original list of products with the search text and value of the checkbox.</li>
    </ul>

<p>So finally, our state is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The search text the user has entered</li>
  <li>The value of the checkbox</li>
</ul>
